# Introduction

People write wrappers around C libraries.

Rust has rules. When you call C code, you must enforce these rules yourself. Unfortunately people
make mistakes when trying to enforce these rules.

---

## Mistake #1
# Leak safety

---

## Mistake #2
# Catching panics in variables

---

## Mistake #3
# Assuming that trait implementations are bug-free

Try to spot the problem:

```rust
fn foo<T: Deref<String>>(string_arg: &T) {
    unsafe {
        let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(string_arg.len());
        ptr::copy(string_arg.as_ptr(), vec.as_mut_ptr(),
                  string_arg.len());
        dst.set_len(string_arg.len());

        // ... do something with the Vec
    }
}
```

Hint:

```rust
let a = string_arg.len();
let b = string_arg.len();
// a == b ?
```

---

## Mistake #3
# Assuming that trait implementations are bug-free

What if I call `foo()` with a `MaliciousPointer`?

```rust
struct MaliciousPointer {
    string1: String,
    string2: String,
}

impl Deref for MaliciousPointer {
    type Target = String;
    fn deref(&self) -> &String {
        if random() < 0.5 { &self.string1 }
        else { &self.string2 }
    }
}
```

---

## Mistake #4
# Hidden global variables

Example: OpenAL.

```rust
extern {
    // Sets the current context. Only one context can be current
    // at any given time. All commands apply to the current context.
    ALCboolean alcMakeContextCurrent(context: *mut ALCcontext);
}
```

This is a global variable hidden inside the OpenAL library!

- This API is not thread-safe, as two different threads can't safely operate on two different
  contexts.
- Cannot be made thread-safe with a lock in your library.

This C API **cannot** be wrapped safely because it was badly designed.

???

Provide explanations about the C API.

In order to use OpenAL, you first create what is called a "context" and set it as current. Then all
the functions that you call apply on the current context.

---

## Mistake #5
# Reading some primitives can cause undefined behaviour

Concerned: `f32`s, `f64`s, `bool`s and `char`s

Rules:
- `bool`s must always be either `0` or `1` <small>(actually, this is unspecified)</small>.
- `char`s must be a valid unicode scalar value</small>.
- Floating-points must never contain signalling NaNs.

```rust
// can be undefined behaviour!
let b: f32 = unsafe { mem::uninitialized() };

// actually undefined behaviour (bad!)
let b: f32 = unsafe { mem::transmute(0x7f800001) };
```

Example situations:

- Do not `transmute` a user-provided sequence of bytes.
- Beware that mapped physical memory may become garbage.

???

By extension, arrays and structs that contain these types are also concerned.

You must make sure that these rules are enforced when you transmute.

Mention Vulkan w.r.t physical memory becoming garbage.

---

## Mistake #6
# Assuming that structs and enums have a certain layout

Example:

```rust
struct Foo {
    a: u8,
    b: u32,
}
```

The compiler can optimize this struct's layout, and `a` may end up being **after** `b` in memory.

Use `#[repr(C)]` to force the layout.

```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct Foo {
    a: u8,
    b: u32,
}
```

???

The compiler will warn you if you try to call an external function with a struct that isn't
`repr(C)`. But it won't warn you if you perform transmutes or pointer casts.

---

# Advice #1: 

Leak-safety (aka. "pre-pooping your pants")
Catching panics in variables
Setting global variables provided by the C library and forgetting that multiple different versions of your library can run at the same time, or can be used together with other libraries that set the same global variables
Relying on the fact that safe trait implementations (like PartialEq, Eq, Deref, ...) are bug-free, while they are not necessarily
Panic safety
Reading f32s/f64s (and bools and chars) from uninitialized memory can cause undefined behavior
Casting from *const to *mut (although I need to read the exact rules for this one first)
Transmuting from a non-repr(C) struct or assuming it has a certain layout
