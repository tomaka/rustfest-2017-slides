Hello everybody,

My name is Pierre Krieger, and this talk is named "the top 9 most common mistakes to avoid when
writing a Rust wrapper around a C library"

---

## What is a wrapper?

Bridge between Rust and C.

<center style="margin: 2em 0"><img src="wrapper.svg" alt="" /></center>

Paradigm shift:

- Safe vs not safe.
- Different API styles.

These differences can cause problems.

???

Before starting, we need to define what a wrapper is.

What we call a wrapper here is simply a Rust library, but that acts as the bridge with a C library.
The idea is that instead of invoking directly the functions from the C library, you instead use
the functions of a wrapper, and this wrapper, in turn, invokes the C library. The advantage of
doing so, is that the wrapper is here in order to handle safety and to provide a convenient API.

But writing a wrapper is not really an easy thing to do, and the differences between Rust and C can
lead to sublte problems. These problems are the subject of this talk.

So here are the 9 most common mistakes people will usually make when writing a wrapper.

---

## Mistake #9
# Not catching Rust panics within callbacks called by the C library

C code is not designed to handle Rust panics.<br />

This is dangerous:

```rust
extern "C" fn my_callback() {
    user_provided_function_that_may_panic();
}

c_library_set_callback(my_callback);
```

???

(1mn10)

Mistake number 9. Not catching Rust panics within callbacks called by the C library.

When your C library uses callbacks, one thing that can be easy to forget is that the C language is
not capable of handling Rust panics. What this means is that if your callback panics, then your
program will crash.

The example code here is dangerous, because you don't know whether
`user_provided_function_that_may_panic` will panic or not. And if it does panic, then it's your
fault for not handling it.

---

## Mistake #9
# Not catching Rust panics within callbacks called by the C library

Instead:

```rust
use std::panic;

extern "C" fn my_callback() {
    let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
        user_provided_function_that_may_panic();
    });

    match result {
        // ...
    }
}
```

???

Instead, you should always use the `catch_unwind` function, as demonstrated here.

(pause)

---

## Mistake #8
# Not testing your wrapper on a large scale

<span style="margin:3em 0;">&nbsp;</span>

Using your own library for a large project is very useful:

- Lets you find flaws in the API.
- Acts as a giant test suit.

???

(1mn55)

Mistake number 8. Not testing your wrapper on a large scale.

Of course, that's more easily said than done. But using your wrapper in an actual real-life
project is really a huge advantage.

For example the best way to spot problems in the API of your wrapper is usually to use the advanced
features of the C library, but advanced features are usually only needed during a large scale
project. So if you don't have one, you may not spot these problems.

Another advantage is that whenever you make a change in your wrapper, you can simply run the
large-scale project as if it was a giant test suit.

So don't be afraid to design your library at the same time as you use it.

---

## Mistake #7
# Assuming that structs and enums have a certain layout

Example:

```rust
struct Foo {
    a: u8,
    b: u32,
}
```

The compiler can optimize this struct's layout, and `a` may even end up being **after** `b` in
memory.

Use `#[repr(C)]` to force the layout.

```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct Foo {
    a: u8,
    b: u32,
}
```

???

(2mn35)

Mistake number 7. Assuming that structs and enums have a certain memory layout.

If you take this example, a struct named `Foo` with two fields named `a` and `b`, you may assume
that `b` is after `a` in memory. In reality the compiler is free to optimize the struct's layout,
even if that means that it needs to change the order of the fields in memory. Which means that `a`
may in reality end up being after `b`.

If you rely on the memory layout of a struct, you **must** mark it as `#[repr(C)]`, as shown here.

Note that the compiler will warn you if you try to call an external function with a struct that
isn't `repr(C)`. But it will not warn you if you perform transmutes or pointer casts.

---

## Mistake #7
# Assuming that structs and enums have a certain layout

Sometimes found in Rust library:

```rust
let src: [u32; 2] = ...;
// very dangerous!
let dst: (u32, u32) = unsafe { mem::transmute(src) };
```

???

(3mn30)

Another example. You sometimes see people transmuting arrays into tuples, or vice-versa. This is
a bad idea, for the same reasons.

---

## Mistake #6
# Trying to write a high-level abstraction first

People will complain about features of the C library that you don't expose.

```rust
extern {
    // Creates objects, and fills `out` with their IDs.
    fn create_objects(num_objects: usize, out: *mut i32);
}

pub struct Object(i32);
impl Object {
    pub fn new() -> Object {
        let mut id = 0; create_objects(1, &mut id); Object(id)
    }
}
```

Outcome:

<img src="complain.png" />

???

(3mn45)

Mistake number 6. Trying to write a high-level abstraction first.

Let's take a look at the example here. The C library you're wrapping around provides a function
named `create_objects`, which can create multiple objects at once.
But in order to make this API more convenient, your Rust wrapper provides a struct named `Object`,
and the `new` function creates a single object by invoking the C function.

If you do this, at one moment or the other, what will most likely happen, is that someone will open
an issue saying that they are calling `Object::new` repeatidely, and asking how they can create
multiple objects at once instead. After all, the C library lets you do so, so why isn't your
wrapper exposing this capability?

There are two ways to handle this issue: either you let the issue sleep forever, or you address it
and you lose time redesigning your library. In both cases, you're losing.

---

## Mistake #6
# Trying to write a high-level abstraction first

Advice:

- Write the closest-to-the-metal API possible while still remaining safe.
- Add additional abstractions over this API afterwards.
- Optimize the higher-level features if needed.

```rust
impl Object {
    // Close to the metal
    pub fn create_objects(num: usize)
                          -> impl Iterator<Item = Object>
    {
        // ...
    }

    // Easy to use
    pub fn new() -> Object {
        Object::create_objects(1).next().unwrap()
    }
}
```

???

(4mn50)

Instead, what I think you should do when you start writing a wrapper, is to start by writing an
API that is as close to the C library as possible. Then, *over* this API, you add your own
convenient API.

For example here, the `create_objects` function makes it possible to create multiple objects at
once, and mimics what the C library provides. But `create_objects` may be inconvenient to use, so
in addition to this you also provide a `new` function that create a single object.

Most people will most likely use the `new` function, but the people who need to be able to create
multiple objects at once will be satisfied with `create_objects`.

Of course in this example, everything's very simple. But this advice scales for even large
wrappers. First writing an API that is as low-level as possible, will make the rest much easier.
Definitely do that.

---

## Mistake #5
# Ignoring the problem of leak safety

Try to spot the problem:

```rust
extern {
    fn lock_foo(foo: *mut Foo);
    fn unlock_foo(foo: *mut Foo);

    // Must not be used while `Foo` is locked.
    fn do_smth(foo: *mut Foo);
}
```

```rust
pub struct FooWrapper { /* ... */ }
impl FooWrapper {
    pub fn do_something(&mut self) { /* call do_smth */ }
    pub fn lock(&mut self) -> Lock { /* calls lock_foo */ }
}

pub struct Lock<'a> { foo: &'a mut FooWrapper }
impl Drop for Lock {
    fn drop(&mut self) { /* calls unlock_foo */ }
}
```

???

(5mn58)

Mistake number 5. Ignoring the problem of leak safety.
And I must warn you that things are going to get a bit more technical from now on.

Let's take a look at this example. The C library provides a type named `Foo`, which isn't shown
here, and three functions. One function to lock a `Foo`, one function to unlock a `Foo` after it's
been locked, and one function named `do_something` that operates on a `Foo`. One important thing
is that `do_something` must not be called on a `Foo` that is currently locked.

Now let's examine the wrapper. The type named `FooWrapper` wraps around `Foo`. It exposes the
`do_something` and the `lock` functions, which mimic the C library. But as you can see, locking the
`Foo` returns a `Lock` object whose destructor unlocks the `Foo`. And one nice thing is that since
the `Lock` holds an exclusive borrow of `FooWrapper`, we are guaranteed that the user *cannot* call
`do_something` or `lock` on a `Foo` that is already locked.

But now, a little game. I give you a few secondsn to try understand what the problem is with this
design.

(pause)

---

## Mistake #5
# Ignoring the problem of leak safety

This is how the wrapper is supposed to be used:

```rust
fn use_foo(foo: &mut FooWrapper) {
    let _lock = foo.lock();
    //foo.do_something();     // compilation error
}
```

This API is safe, right? 
No, because you can bypass the borrow!

```rust
fn use_foo(foo: &mut FooWrapper) {
    {
        let lock = foo.lock();
        mem::forget(lock);
    }

    // foo is still locked at this point
    foo.do_something();     // compiles and runs, but bad!
}
```

Rule: Always consider that your destructors may not get called.

???

(7mn29)

Ok, let's see what the problem is.

You can see in the first block of code how the wrapper is supposed to be used. You have a
`FooWrapper` and you lock it. If you try to call `do_something` while the lock is in place, then
you will get a compilation error. This is because `do_something` requires an exclusive borrow of
`FooWrapper`, but the lock already holds an exclusive borrow. And having two exclusive borrows at
the same time is forbidden.

At the end of function, the lock is dropped, and this unlocks the `Foo`.

So this API must be safe, right? No because you can bypass the borrow by calling the `forget`
function. This is demonstrated in the second block of code.

When you call `forget`, the lock will simply stop existing and its destructors will not be called.
The user will then be able to call `do_something`, even though the `Foo` is still locked from the
point of view of the C library. And everything falls apart.

---

## Mistake #5
# Ignoring the problem of leak safety

Pre-pooping your pants:

```rust
pub struct FooWrapper {
    foo: *mut Foo,
    is_locked: bool,
}
impl FooWrapper {
    pub fn do_something(&mut self) {
        assert!(!self.is_locked); /* call do_smth */
    }
    pub fn lock(&mut self) -> Lock {
        assert!(!self.is_locked);
        self.is_locked = true;
        /* call lock_foo */
    }
}
impl Drop for Lock {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        self.0.is_locked = false; /* call unlock_foo */
    }
}
```

???

(8mn33)

What you need to do in order to make this safe, is add a field named `is_locked` in your wrapper.
This field checks at runtime whether the `Foo` is locked.

This solution may look nasty to you, because we turned a compile-time check into a runtime check.
However it's unfortunately the only solution if you want your wrapper to be safe.

And this technique is named "pre-pooping your pants", if you want to google it.

---

## Mistake #4
# Forgetting about hidden global variables

Example: *OpenAL*, a sound playback library.

```rust
extern {
    // Sets the current context. Only one context can be current
    // at any given time. All commands apply to the current context.
    fn alcMakeContextCurrent(ctxt: *mut ALCcontext) -> ALCboolean;
}
```

This is a global variable hidden inside the OpenAL library!

This design is not thread-safe (at all).

???

(9mn03)

Mistake number 4. Forgetting about hidden global variables.

And I'm going to take the example of the OpenAL library here. In order to use OpenAL, you first create
what is called a "context" and then you set this context as current by calling the `alcMakeContextCurrent`
function. Then once you've done so, all the other functions of OpenAL apply on the current context.

If you think a bit about it, this concept of having a "current context" is essentially just a
global variable, hidden inside the OpenAL library.

This is a problematic design, because two threads cannot safely operate on two different contexts.
If you're performing some operations on thread 1, and in the meanwhile thread 2 changes the current
context then it will change the behaviour of thread 1. This is not thread safe.

---

## Mistake #4
# Forgetting about hidden global variables

But what about a `Mutex`?

```rust
lazy_static! {
    static ref CURRENT_CONTEXT_MUTEX: Mutex<()> = Mutex::new(());
}

pub fn do_something() {
    let _lock = CURRENT_CONTEXT_MUTEX.lock().unwrap();
    alcMakeContextCurrent(/* ... */);
    // ...
}
```

???

(10mn35)

But what if we used a mutex, to protect against this problem?

The idea is, that every time we need to do something with OpenAL, we first lock a mutex and then
only we call `alcMakeContextCurrent`. This way, if the user calls `do_something` multiple times
from multiple different threads, then we're still safe.

This must be safe, right? (short pause)

---

## Mistake #4
# Forgetting about hidden global variables

The `Mutex` solution doesn't work.

Cargo may pull multiple different versions of our wrapper:

```
Project
|- OpenAL-wrapper v0.2
|- Other-sound-library v0.1
   |- OpenAL-wrapper v0.1
```

If `Project` uses functions from `OpenAL-wrapper` and `Other-sound-library` simultaneously, they
will each lock a different `Mutex`, but they will both still refer to the same "current context"
in OpenAL.

???

(11mn03)

Unfortunately, that's not a good solution. The solution with the mutex doesn't work. Here's why.

Let's say that I create a project with two dependencies. The first dependency is the OpenAL
wrapper, and the second dependency is a third-party sound library. And this third-party sound
library also depends on the OpenAL wrapper under the hood, but a different version as the one used
by the main project.

What will happen if you do that, is that Cargo will pull the two different versions of the OpenAL
wrapper. And unfortunately the two different versions will have two different mutexes. Which means
that if the project uses, at the same time, a function from the OpenAL wrapper and a function from
the third-party library, then they will conflict.

---

## Mistake #4
# Forgetting about hidden global variables

Conclusion: *OpenAL* **cannot** be wrapped safely, because of its design.

Other examples of impossible APIs:

- Xlib (because of `XSetErrorHandler`)
- getenv/setenv (fortunately, the stdlib wraps around it)

Examples of APIs that can be safely wrapped but where you need to be careful:

- OpenGL
- Several Windows APIs
- All the libraries with a global initialization function
- ...

???

(12mn05)

As a conclusion, OpenAL simply cannot be wrapped safely. And that's because of its design.
Or if you can, then I didn't figure out how. Let me know if you have an idea.

Here are some other examples of libraries, that are impossible to wrap around safely. `getenv`
and `setenv` have the same problem as explained, fortunately the stdlib wraps around them, and
since there can only be one stdlib at a time in a program, then it's actually safe.

In addition to libraries that are impossible to wrap around, there are also libraries that can be
wrapped around but where you need to be extra careful. OpenGL has a concept of current context,
but it only applies to the current thread. Some Windows APIs also have functions that modify
a property of the current thread. There are really tons of C libraries that have some sort of
hidden global variables. So be careful.

---

## Mistake #3
# Reading primitives from memory without checking

Concerned: `f32`s, `f64`s, `bool`s and `char`s

```rust
// can be undefined behaviour!
let b: bool = unsafe { mem::uninitialized() };

// actually undefined behaviour (bad!)
// 0x7f800001 is a bit pattern corresponding to a signalling NaN
let b: f32 = unsafe { mem::transmute(0x7f800001) };
```

Rules:
- `bool`s must always be either `0` or `1` <small>(actually, this is unspecified)</small>.
- `char`s must be a valid unicode scalar value</small>.
- Floating-points must never contain signalling NaNs.

???

(12mn25)

Mistake number 3. Reading primitives from memory without checking.

This concerns the situation where you have a pointer to some memory, like a void pointer for
example, and you would like to read data from it.

If you're reading a floating point, a boolean, or a char, then you have to be sure that the
content of the memory is valid for that given type. For example for bools, the memory must
contain either `0` or `1`, and nothing else. If the memory happens to contain something else, and
you read it, then you have an undefined behaviour, which can even make the program crash.

When it comes to chars, the value must be a valid unicode scalar value. And when it comes to
floating points, the value must not correspond to a signalling NaN.

And by extension, structs that are made of these types are also concerned.

---

## Mistake #3
# Reading primitives from memory without checking

How to check:

- Use `f32::from_bits` or `f64::from_bits` when reading a floating-point.
- Instead of reading a `bool`, read an integer `a` and do `a != 0`.
- For `char`, use `std::char::from_u32`.

???

(13mn25)

Here is how to solve this problem.

Use `from_bits` function when reading a floating-point.

Instead of reading a `bool`, read an integer `a` and do `a != 0`.

And for `char`, use the `from_u32` function.

---

## Mistake #2
# Assuming that trait implementations are bug-free

Try to spot the problem:

```rust
extern {
    // `pointer` must be an array of `len` elements
    fn foo(pointer: *const c_char, len: size_t);
}

pub fn foo_wrapper<T>(array_arg: &T)
    where T: Deref<[u8]>
{
    unsafe {
        foo(
            array_arg.as_ptr() as *const c_char,
            array_arg.len()
        );
    }
}
```

???

(13mn52)

Mistake number 2. Assuming that trait implementations are bug-free.

This one can be really tricky.

Let's take a look. We have a C function named `foo`, which accepts an array that consists of a
pointer and a number of elements.

Below you can see the `foo_wrapper` function, which is our attempt to wrap around `foo`. It accepts
any type that dereferences to an array, then calls the `as_ptr` and `len` methods on this array,
which return what we need in order to call `foo`. And then it calls `foo`.

I'll give you a few seconds in order to try to guess what is wrong with this code.

(pause)

---

## Mistake #2
# Assuming that trait implementations are bug-free

The user could create a type named `MaliciousPointer` and call `foo_wrapper` with it!

```rust
struct MaliciousPointer {
    vec1: Vec<u8>,
    vec2: Vec<u8>,
}

impl Deref for MaliciousPointer {
    type Target = [u8];
    fn deref(&self) -> &[u8] {
        if random() < 0.5 { &self.vec1 }
        else { &self.vec2 }
    }
}
```

???

(14mn35)

Here is the solution. The `foo_wrapper` function accepts as parameter any type that implements
the `Deref` trait. Which means that we can create our own type that implements `Deref`, and then
pass it to `foo_wrapper`.

Take a look at this code. We have a struct named `MaliciousPointer` that consists of two `Vec`,
and that implements `Deref` in such a way, that it will sometimes return the first `Vec` and
sometimes return the second `Vec`.

Now take a look at what happens if we use it.

---

## Mistake #2
# Assuming that trait implementations are bug-free

The user could create a type named `MaliciousPointer` and call `foo_wrapper` with it!

```rust
pub fn foo_wrapper<T: Deref<[u8]>>(array_arg: &T) {
    unsafe {
        foo(
            // could be a pointer to the first Vec ...
            array_arg.as_ptr() as *const c_char,
            // ... but with the length of the second Vec
            array_arg.len()
        );
    }
}
```

Ouch!

???

(15mn05)

Here is our `foo_wrapper` function, the same as above.

When we call `array_arg.as_ptr()`, what happens is that we actually first call `deref`, and then
only `as_ptr` on the result of `deref`. Similarly when we call `array_arg.len()`, we call `deref`
again, and then `len` on the result of the second `deref`.

If we pass a `MaliciousPointer` as parameter, what can end up happening is that we obtain a pointer
to the first `Vec` with the length of the second `Vec`, or vice-versa. Which could lead to a
segfault.

One important to note though. In this example, it was a *malicious* implementation of `Deref`.
But in a real program, it could be an actual bug in the trait implementation that could be
exploited.

So, how do we solve this?

---

## Mistake #2
# Assuming that trait implementations are bug-free

Solution #1: deref at the start.

```rust
pub fn foo_wrapper<T: Deref<[u8]>>(array_arg: &T) {
    unsafe {
        let array_arg = array_arg.deref();
        foo(array_arg.as_ptr() as *const c_char, array_arg.len());
    }
}
```

???

(15mn55)

The first solution to solve this, is to call `deref` at the start of the function.

This code here is safe.

(pause)

---

## Mistake #2
# Assuming that trait implementations are bug-free

Solution #2: a custom unsafe trait.

```rust
pub unsafe trait SafeDeref: Deref {}
unsafe impl<T> SafeDeref for Arc<T> {}
unsafe impl<T> SafeDeref for Box<T> {}

pub fn foo_wrapper<T>(array_arg: &T)
    where T: UnsafeDeref<[u8]>
{
    unsafe {
        foo(
            array_arg.as_ptr() as *const c_char,
            array_arg.len()
        );
    }
}
```

???

(16mn07)

But sometimes the first solution can be too constraining, so there's a second solution, which is
to create your own alternative trait with an `unsafe` marker.

This time the `foo_wrapper` function only accepts types which are guaranteed to implement `Deref`
in a bug-free way. The safety is enforced by the two `unsafe impl` lines at the top.

(pause)

---

## Mistake #2
# Assuming that trait implementations are bug-free

Other example traits to watch for and that can be implemented in a weird fashion:

- `AsRef`
- `Borrow`
- `PartialEq`
- `Eq`
- `PartialOrd`
- `Ord`
- `Hash`
- `Iterator`

???

(16mn35)

Here are some other traits to watch for, that could lead to safety problems.

(read the list)

---

## Mistake #1
# Using lifetimes for long-lived objects

Example situation: a C library gives you two objects of type `A` and `B`, and states that `A` must
outlive `B`.

The common solution: store a `&A` inside of `B`.

```rust
struct B<'a> {
    parent: &'a A,
}
```

???

(16mn47)

And the top mistake. Using lifetimes for long-lived objects.

Lots of C libraries provide objects that have a parent-child relationship, and state that you
must keep the parent alive while you use the child.

What many people do in this situation is use a lifetime to represent this relationship.
In the example code here, the child, named `B`, holds a reference to its parent, named `A`.

---

## Mistake #1
# Using lifetimes for long-lived objects

However using a lifetime is more restrictive than just the concept of "outlives".

```rust
// Code written by someone trying to use your library
struct HighLevelCode {
    parent: A,
    child: B<???>,      // impossible to write
}
```

Advice:

- Only use lifetimes for temporary objects (such as locks or accessors).
- Use `Arc`/`Rc` for dependencies between long-lived objects.

???

(17mn12)

However, lifetimes are more restrictive than just the concept of "outlives".

When you have a reference to an object, it also enforces the fact that the object cannot be moved,
which ends up being very annoying for the people who use your wrapper.

If you take a look at the example code here, you can see that it's impossible to put both the
parent and the child in the same struct. It should technically be possible to do this, but we can't
because lifetimes are too restrictive.

So what do we do?

I advise you to use lifetimes only when you're dealing with temporary objects.

In other situations, like in this example with `A` and `B`, you should simply use `Arc`s or
`Rc`s.

# Conclusion

**Read the rustonomicon: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/**

If you feel overwhelmed by the safety-related issues, think about the fact that safe Rust protects
against all these problems.

Take inspiration from the API guidelines:<br />https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/api-guidelines/

As a conclusion, if you're dealing with unsafe code, I strongly suggest you to read the
rustonomicon, whose address is here.

And if you're not manipulating unsafe code, and you feel overwhelmed by all the safety-related
issues, remember that safe Rust protects you against all these problems. So you don't need to
worry about them.

Other than that, take inspiration from the API guidelines, which are also linked there. They are
not perfect in my opinion, but they are a good starting place.
